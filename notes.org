* Changes
** Non-referenceable built-in predicates: e.g. INPUT, OUTPUT, IMPORT, EXPORT, TYPEOF
- Disallow at grammar level.

* Questions
** Do we really need types?
- Can we replace types with strings?
- Update the TYPEOF predicate such that it does not use lists

** Can we write a datalog program that typechecks itself?
